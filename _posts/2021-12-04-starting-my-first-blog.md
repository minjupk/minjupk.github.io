<p>I've never actually created a blog before and I'm not really good at keeping records.</p>
<p>That has never been my strong forte.</p>

<p>However I'm hoping this will encourage me to research interesting tech & development topics.</p>
<P>I'm going to try to create at least one blog post per a week. There are plenty of interesting things happening in software development world. I'm never going to run out of topics üòù</P>
